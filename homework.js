The variable murderer was reassigned on line 43 to Mrs Peacock, however it's only used in that block of code so when the variable murderer is referenced again on line 50 it refers back to its original assignment on line 40 (of Professor Plum).

// Suspect three is reassigned in the function declareAllSuspects, however it's only reassigned in that block of code, so when suspect three is called later on it refers to the original assigment on line 59 - Mrs Peacock.
